 * @param {boolean} [props.focused=false] - Offers a prop interface for forcing the video to start/stop without DOM events
 *                                      When set to true, the video will begin playing and any events that would normally stop it will be ignored

 *                                                  particularly due to a known bug in Google Chrome, if too many videos are loading in the background at the same time,
 *                                                  it starts to gum up the works so that nothing loads properly and performance can degrade significantly.

 * @param {boolean} [props.disablePictureInPicture=true] - Prevents the browser from showing picture-in-picture controls on the video
 * @param {string}  [props.className] - Optional className to apply custom styling to the container element
 * @param {object}  [props.style] - Style object to apply custom inlined styles to the hover player container
 * @param {string}  [props.pausedOverlayWrapperClassName] - Optional className to apply custom styling to the overlay contents' wrapper
 * @param {object}  [props.pausedOverlayWrapperStyle] - Style object to apply custom inlined styles to the paused overlay wrapper
 * @param {string}  [props.loadingOverlayWrapperClassName] - Optional className to apply custom styling to the loading state overlay contents' wrapper

 *                                         - **"video"**: Everything should be sized based on the video element's dimensions - the overlays will expand to cover the video
 *                                         - **"overlay"**: Everything should be sized based on the paused overlay's dimensions - the video element will expand to fit inside those dimensions
 *                                         - **"container"**: Everything should be sized based on the player's outer container div - the overlays and video will all expand to cover the container
 *                                         - **"manual"**: Manual mode does not apply any special styling and allows the developer to exercise full control over how everything should be sized - this means you will likely need to provide your own custom styling for both the paused overlay and the video element
